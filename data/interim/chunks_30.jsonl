STRATEGIC CONTEXT \nA. Country Context \n1. Despite significant economic and social progress over the last decade, Afghanistan \nfaces formidable medium to long term development challenges.  An average of 9.4 percent \nannual economic growth over 2003 -2012, driven mainly by investments in reconstruction and \naid flows, has fueled  the services sector . Periodic surges in agricultural production helped raise \nGDP per-capita from $186 in 2002 to $688 in 2012. P er capita GDP, however, is still the lowest \nin Asia and amongst the lowest 20 countries of the world. Key soci al indicators have also \nimproved1, but p overty levels are high. 36 percent of the population lives below the national \npoverty line and over fifty percent are considered vulnerable2.   \n \n2. A highly aid dependent country in conflict and with extremely fragil e institutions, \nAfghanistan is in the midst of a critical security and economic transition 3. Presidential \nelections are scheduled for April 2014 4, and the Government is assuming leadership for both \nsecurity and development from the international community by the end of 2014.  Aid levels are \nexpected to fall as is growth in 2014. Future aid levels remain uncertain even if there is a smooth \ntransition. Fiscal sustainability, job -creating growth, human development and governance will \nremain dominant themes for the development agenda over the short to medium term.  \n \n3.

The need to improve public service delivery, generate \nemployment and improve inco mes, and most importantly, strengthen institutional capacities in \nmunicipal governance is critical due to urban population growth. \n \n4.

Over the past decade (2002 -2013), over two million refugees, or 46% of the refugee \nreturnee population, have ret urned to urban areas - 36% to Kabul  (UNHCR). Consequently, \nsocial, economic and political stability require urgent attention to inclusive urban development.  \n \nB. Sectoral and Institutional Context \n5. Kabul, already home to over half of Afghanistan’s urban population 10 and still \ngrowing, faces significant infrastructure and service delivery deficiencies. Originally planned \nfor less than one million  people, Kabul now ranks  86th among the world’s largest \nagglomerations11. It’s population has  doubled since 2004, and  was estimated to be over 4 \nmillion12 in 2012.

The Government recognizes the  need for urban development policies to improve  \nresource utilization . It also recognizes  that infrastructure provision is as necessary as making \navailable adequate resources for operations and maintenance  (O&M) of assets . This requires \nclarity on urban management responsibilities and strengthening municipal management .  In \n2010, the Government developed specific National Priority Programs (NPPs) to improve service \ndelivery. Successful i mplementation of these  NPPs would enhance service delivery, generate \nemployment and improve incomes, and strengthen institutional capacities.  However, the \ncomprehensive com pletion of all these steps will  take time .

The rationale for Bank involvement in the urban sector in Afghanistan is to establish a \nfoundation for municipal development  that contributes to macroeconomic growth .  This \nrationale draws on the Bank’s support for municipal development in more than twenty countries \nover the last three decades. This experience highlights that integrated development in large cities \nrequires refo rms and investments, and reforms take time.

Higher Level Objectives to which the Project Contributes \n10. The World Bank’s Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for the Islamic Republic of \nAfghanistan (IRoA18) is grounded in helping the government  with the transition in 2014 and \nbeyond. The project is  consistent with all three pillars of  the ISN for 2012 -2014: (i) building \nlegitimacy of institutions  - the project will establish a road map for  strengthening both KM’s \nfinancial management and planning capacity  which, once implemented,  will contribute to \nimproved service delivery;  (ii) providing equitable service delivery - delivery of basic municipal \nservices in unserved residential settlements will positively reaffirm the legitimacy of residents by \ninitiating a process for their inclusion through the integration of their settlements with the city’s \nmain infrastructure; (iii) inclusive growth and jobs  - through labor intensive municipal \ninfrastructure works, the project will directly generate over 2 million man days of u nskilled jobs \nin the construction sector 19, stimulate indirect economic benefits in the targeted areas and their \nvicinity, and strengthen the role of women in the targeted communities 20.

Sustainability \n \n28. The institutional development impact of urban upgrading supported under KURP has \nbeen significant 39 and the government has expressed keen interest in scaling -up the results \nachieved under the KURP to  integrate informal settlements into the main fabric of Kabul. A \nNational Upgrading Poli cy, developed by the Ministry of Urban Development Affairs \n(MoUDA), provides a framework for all urban municipalities to undertake upgrading and deliver \nbasic municipal services to un -served or under -served human se ttlements. Ownership at the \ncommunity level has been addressed throughout project preparation by applying processes guided \nby the Community Consultation Manual (CCM) 40 – participation by beneficiaries, as under \nKURP, will have a direct impact on KMDP’s ability to manage social safeguard issues.  \n \n29.

The overall security situation in Afghanistan makes any operation in the country highly \nrisky due to political and economic uncertainties as well as difficulties in project implementation \nand supervis ion. Deterioration in the security situation exacerbates risks, especially given the  \ndependence of the construction industry on imports. Specific sector related risks are mostly due \nto inadequacies in planning, budgeting, a nd execution in KM. Project preparation progress has \nbeen satisfactory because of the qual ity of staff in KM’s KMDP Team. Governance risks are \nbeing addressed on a countrywide basis and will also  be followed in this pro ject.

APPRAISAL SUMMARY \nA. Economic Analysis \n \n31. Economic evaluation was undertaken on the basis of land/property value increases in \nselect neighborhoods upgraded under KURP, which are similar to the sites to be upgraded under \nKMDP. Similarities between the KMDP sites and KURP sites exist in terms of population \ndensity and infrastructure upgrading costs. The analysis was conducted for three representative \nsites41: a planned settlement, a"}

The analysis was conducted for three representative \nsites41: a planned settlement, an unplanned settlement, and a  mixed settlement. The analysis \nconsidered “with” and “without” the project scenarios. Expected benefits include time savings, \nas a result of the provision of all -weather road access to homes; expansion of drinking water \nsupply, which in addition to time savings is expected to also reduce income loss due to sickness \nand medical expenses; and increased economic growth. The economic rate of return of providing \nbasic services in the three settlements ranges between 74% and 95%. On average, the net present \nvalue of upgrading is approximately US$1.24  million/hectare at a 10 percent discount rate.  The \neconomic evaluation was not updated with the additional investments in goods for the roads and \nsanitation department that were added after pre-appraisal42. No quantitative economic analysis \nwas carried out for the other components. Studies for the redesign of KM FM system and the \ndrainage studies will yield benefits that are not easily quantifiable as they are inputs for future \nsupport. The HH survey will provide data for monitoring the demand side for service delivery, \nand investment planning. \n \n32. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to evaluate the impact of changes in costs and \nbenefits on the base case estimates. The combined effect of 20 p ercent increase in costs and a \ndecrease of the same amount in benefits for each of the sites was computed (Table 3). The ERR \nfor the informal and mixed sites were revised to 80 percent and 82 percent , respectively. For the \nplanned site, ERR diminished to 6 4 percent as against 74 percent in "}
